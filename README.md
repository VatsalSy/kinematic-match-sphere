# Kinematic Match: The case of a rigid sphere and an elastic membrane
This repository serves a supplementary material for [this article](google.com). Here we provide code in Julia, Matlab and Python to simulate an axis-symmetric impact between a rigid sphere and an elastic thin membrane.

## Usage

All three languages have a main script, called `solveMotion`, and the initial conditions of the impact can be passed as name-value pairs. Parameters corresponding to the simulation analyzed in detail in the article are run by default when `solveMotion` it's called with no arguments. 




## TODO

- [ ] Implement sparse matrices on Python
- [ ] Standarize variable names across three projects. 
- [ ] Include scripts used to generate the plots of our article
- [ ] Benchmark all three versions
